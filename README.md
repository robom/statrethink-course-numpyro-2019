# Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using Python and NumPyro

## Introduction

This repo is a fork of the [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using Python and NumPyro 2019](https://github.com/asuagar/statrethink-course-numpyro-2019) by Andrés Suárez who provided a `python`/`numpyro` version of the [Statistical Rethinking course](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) taught by Professor Richard McElreath on the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig during the Winter of 2019/2020. Since there is a new [2022 edition](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) of the course, this work tries to provide an updated version.

This introductory course to Bayesian modelling is also accompanied by Statistical Rethinking [book](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) written by Professor McElreath and with [code examples](https://fehiepsi.github.io/rethinking-numpyro/) ported to `python`/`numpyro` by Du Phan.

## List of notebooks

* [Week 1](statrethink_numpyro_w01.ipynb)

## How to use this repo

[]: # (All the notebooks can be interactively used through the "launch binder" button located in the top of this file.)
The course is underway and the new lectures and assignments are still being added (currently, there are 7 lectures out of 20 available). I will eventually update all the original 2019/2020 version of the notebooks. In the meantime, the original (yet-to-be-updated) notebooks are prefixed by "_".

Install all requirements:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then:
1. Go to the notebook of the week.
2. Watch the two videos for the lectures of that week.
3. Read the original problems presented to the students and try to solve them on your own.
4. Follow the exercises solutions of the notebook with the provided code and explanations by Professor McElreath.
